# Lecture Video Summarization
This code was used as my final project for the Applied Deep Learning class (COMS 4995) undertaken at Columbia University during Fall 2020. 
The code is split into 4 parts.
- Preprocessing 
- Basic Word Embedding Based Summarization
- Extractive Summarization with BERT 
- Abstractive Summarization
